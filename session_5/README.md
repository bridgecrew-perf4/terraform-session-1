#### Terraform backend

If you are a team who is using Terraform to manage your infrastructure, terraform recommends using remote backend file instead of locally storing your tfstate file. Storing your backend tfstate file in AWS S3 bucket is one of the options. When we store our tfstate file remotely it allows us to be more flexible for working with  group of people(team). Because all the team members can have access to it and it will make teamwork smooth. But before we configure storing our tfstate in S3 bucket, we have to make sure it exists. After that we run terraform init which initializes storing our backend in given remote S3 bucket. It makes it easy to differentiate environments which you want to provision your infra. For that reason we use folder structure, which allows us to keep our backend files for each environment separately. we created separate folders for each environment.
